# ***HAY DAY***
## *SUMMARY* 
### This is a fresh man's **java term project**, which is a java2D game **without any game engines, 100% HAND CODING!** Without **LGP**'s help, I have to PS all images by myself, so miss him!

## *HOW2PLAY*
### You can click on **GUIDE** button and get help and there is also a **HELP** in game frame.

## *VERSION*
### **Beta1.0** is raw, if you just want to play the game, you can skip it. But in beta1.0, game logic code has already done, thus, it is a simply version for those who want to see my code. 
### **Beta2.0** is a basically mature version, I update **SAVE** and **LOAD** and some UIs. Even though BGM and map and plot are not good yet, it is doesn't matter, because my coding makes it very easy to update new things. Just time-consuming.

## *DEVELOP ENVIRONMENT*
### Firstly, I use **VScode** to build the project and workplace, it is really **AMAZING** in coding experience, smart one. But when I want to package the project, it drives me crazy. So I download **Eclipse** back and package the project. Compared with VScode, to be honest, **IDE** such as Eclipse maybe better for **project**.

## *BASIC KNWOLEDGE*
### **JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, JButton**, I only use these UI components. Game is an interactive program, so **Threads** is a must. I tried to use Timer to control gameloop, **USELESS**!

## *CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK*
### Though there are a number of game engines fro game development, this is not for me. This time, I learn lots of things, especially **Java's programing thoughts**(OOP) as a programer. This game is more mature than that summer one, within my personal improvement. I'll keep updating this game till the term project DDL, but not frequently. **If you have played this game and find bugs or have proposals, welcome to show me, with my best appreciation**.

## *LAST BUT NOT LEAST*
### Game can be only run in JRE 1.7 or higher and a 64-bits equipment. All image resources are public and come from Internet.
